<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>There can be numerous maping problems that we can solve using machine learning but I doubt if anyone has ever tried maping a circuit given it's input and output using machine learning.It is certainly insanely tough task because we can barely do it ourselves but if it can be done than maybe someday we can do this to map entire brain </p>
